<span style="font-size:large;font-weight:bold;"> Welcome to my homepage! </span>
<br/>

I am currently a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, working with [Prof. Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). I received my Ph.D. degree at Nanyang Technological University, advised by [Prof. Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree from Tianjin University under the supervision of [Prof. Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html) and B.Eng. degree from Jiangnan University. 

## Research Interests
- (Security) Game Theory Algorithm
- In-Context Learning for Games
- (LLM-based) Agent-based Modeling
