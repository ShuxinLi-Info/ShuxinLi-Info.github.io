<span style="font-size:large;font-weight:bold;"> Welcome to my homepage! </span>
<br/>

I am currently a **Research Fellow** at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working with [Prof. Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University, where I was also supervised by [Prof. Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). Prior to that, I obtained my M.Eng. degree from Tianjin University under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaohong Li](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/lxh/index-english.html) and [Prof. Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html), and my B.Eng. degree from Jiangnan University. 

## Research Interests
- (Security) Game Theory Algorithm
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- In-Context Learning for Games
- (LLM-based) Agent-based Modeling
